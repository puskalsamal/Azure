Welcome to the ArcGIS Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates wiki!


Esri provides Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates and a shell script to help you deploy ArcGIS Enterprise along with necessary infrastructure using automation environments such as Azure Cloud Shell or command line interfaces (requires azure cli installed). The repository also contains some sample parameter files for different ArcGIS Enterprise deployment patterns which are available under 'Release/{arcgis-release-version}/SampleParams' folder

See wiki pages for more information about using ArcGIS Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.

For development and testing, we also provide self signed SSL certificates. These are meant for development use only and will require browsers and application to accept them explicitly.

Please use the script 'deployArcGISSite.sh' to help with automated deployment using Azure Cloud Shell.
