Welcome to the ArcGIS Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates wiki!


Esri provides Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates and a bash script to help you deploy an ArcGIS Enterprise along with necessary infrastructure using Azure Cloud Shell. The repository also contains some sample parameter files for different ArcGIS deployment patterns which are available under 'Release/{arcgis-release-version}/SampleParams' folder

See wiki pages for more information about using ArcGIS Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.

We also provide a script 'deployArcGISSite.sh' to help with the deployment using Azure CloudShell.
